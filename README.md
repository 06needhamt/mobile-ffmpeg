External libraries and their dependencies are explained in the [External Libraries](https://github.com/tanersener/mobile-ffmpeg/wiki/External-Libraries) page.
### 4. Using
\* You can use prebuilt library binaries from the following locations
### 4.1 Android
### 4.2 IOS

### 5. Building
- pkg-config required by freetype and ffmpeg

- gcc required by freetype
- cmake v3.9.x or later required by libwebp
- gperf required by fontconfig
- yasm required for libvpx


#### 4.1 Android

Android NDK and gradle is required to build Android platform

#### 4.2 IOS

XCode is required to build IOS platform. Command Line Tools, go to https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ MacOS

autoconf automake libtool

- export PATH=${PATH}:/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin by gnutls
- curl, lipo for IOS

\* Use `android.sh` to build FFmpeg for Android. Visit [android.sh](https://github.com/tanersener/mobile-ffmpeg/wiki/android.sh) page for all build options.

### 6. API

\* MobileFFmpeg API defines

### 7. Known Issues

- On very few occasions, top level build scripts fail to build one of the external libraries randomly. When the details are analyzed it is seen that compilation fails due to not-existing cpu specific instructions.
Somehow cleaning the previous architecture build fails and this breaks the new compilation for that library. When the top level script is run again the error disappears.
It wasn't possible to find the exact cause of this issue since it happens rarely and disappears on the next run.
